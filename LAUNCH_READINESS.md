# Launch Readiness Record

This document is the **single gate** for production releases.
A release cannot be labelled production-ready until every blocking area below
has an approved sign-off with a link to supporting evidence.

Fill in this template for each release candidate.  Archive completed copies in
`docs/releases/LAUNCH_READINESS_<version>_<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`.

> **Blocking criteria summary:** A section is considered blocked if any
> criterion marked 🔴 (blocking) has Status = ☐ (incomplete) without an
> accepted open-risk entry.  The release manager must not approve until all
> 🔴 rows are either ✅ (complete) or have an open-risk row with a named owner
> and expiry date.

## Release metadata

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Release version | *e.g. v1.0.0* |
| Release candidate tag / commit | *e.g. `v1.0.0-rc1` @ `abc1234`* |
| Release manifest path | *`docs/releases/manifest-<version>.json`* |
| Target environment | *testnet / mainnet* |
| Planned release date | |
| Release manager | *@github-handle* |
| Sign-off deadline | |

### Release manifest attachment

Before approving the release, the release manager must confirm:

- [ ] `bun run release:manifest` has been run for this commit and the output file
  committed to `docs/releases/manifest-<version>.json`.
- [ ] The manifest `release.commit` field matches the commit being released.
- [ ] The manifest `database.latest_migration` field is consistent with what is
  applied in the target environment.

## How to use this document

1. Copy this template to `docs/releases/LAUNCH_READINESS_<version>_<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`.
2. Assign an owner (GitHub handle) to each section.
3. Each owner must:
   a. Complete their section.
   b. Link to evidence (test reports, audit results, monitoring dashboards, CI run URLs).
   c. Add their GitHub handle + date under **Sign-off**.
4. Open risks must have: owner, impact assessment, mitigation, and expiry date.
5. The release manager reviews all sections and confirms the release is unblocked.
6. This completed document is committed alongside the release tag.
7. This document plus the `manifest-<version>.json` are attached to the GitHub
   release notes.

**Legend:**
- 🔴 = Blocking criterion — release is blocked until this is satisfied or risk-accepted.
- 🟡 = Advisory criterion — noted but does not block release on its own.
- ✅ = Complete.  ☐ = Incomplete / not yet checked.

**Blocking areas**: Functional, Security, Contract, Payment, Accessibility,
Performance, Privacy, Monitoring, Backup, Support.
